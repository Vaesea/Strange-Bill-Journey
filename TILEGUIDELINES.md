If you intend for your tile to be in the game, follow these guidelines.
1. Make sure the tile is some sort of pixel art. I recommend using piskel for the pixel art.
2. Make sure the tile is 32x32 or have one of the 32 in 32x32 to a multiple of 32, like, 32x64 or 64x32 or 128x32 or 32x128 or 64x64 or 128x128 or whatever you want, just make sure the numbers are 32 or a multiple of 32!
3. 32
4. If you intend the tile to be interactive, put a CollisionShape2D on it or put the Collision Polygon Node or something MAKE SURE THE COLLISION IS 2D!!!!!!!!!!!!
5. :3
6. If it's a whole tileset, make sure it loops well, at least, and also make sure you make it a spritesheet. Don't make the same mistake I did with it being different images, make sure it's like desertnew.png with it's spritesheet instead of individual images.
