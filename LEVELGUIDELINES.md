These are if you intend to make a level that is for the official game.
1. Use the level template in data/levels/test/template.tscn
2. Make sure tiles that are meant to be interactive are in interactive tiles.
3. Make sure tiles that are meant to be behind the interactive tiles without collision are in background tiles.
4. Make sure tiles that are meant to be in front of the interactive tiles without collision are in foreground tiles.
5. You can add new Node2Ds to put tiles in. It's sort of like SuperTux's tilemaps.
6. Make sure objects such as the end sign and Bill are in the objects Node2D.
7. Use Godot v4.2.2 to edit and create levels. There isn't an official level editor yet, I don't know how to make a level editor, even after watching a tutorial. Too confusing.
8. Levels have a height of 23 tiles.
9. Make sure levels are at least 30 seconds.
10. Tiles are 32x32. Make sure you set your grid snapping to 32x32! Objects can break this rule, just not tiles, unless you do it in a way that looks and plays good.
11. Focus on how the level plays more than how the level looks. This game is meant to be fun. As Reggie once said, If it's not fun, why bother?
12. Please please PLEASE don't copy another platformer's levels.
13. Make sure the levels aren't too easy or too difficult. Try to have another person test it. Especially if it's area 1 / Doz Desert :3
14. You can use custom tiles and songs, and if the level is accepted, those will be accepted too.
