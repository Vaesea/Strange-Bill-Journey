Current Version: Pre-0.0.1.0, NOT AN ACTUAL VERSION BECAUSE 0.0.1.0 WILL BE THE ACTUAL FIRST VERSION)

### READ CREDITS.md FOR THE CREDITS.

# How To Label Versions:
First Number is Release, so let's say it's 1 for the example. 0 means it's not in any release version yet.

Second Number is Major, so let's say it's 2 for the example. 0 means it's not any major new version. It can also mean a new milestone, with the last version of the game with the number being 2 would be the finished Milestone 2 (0.2.9.0, for example)

Third Number is Minor, so let's say it's 3 for example. 0 means it's either not a new minor version or it's the first version of a milestone, (0.3.0.0, for example)

Fourth Number is very minor, so let's say it's 4 for example. 0 means it's eitehr not a new minor version or it's the first version of a milestone (0.4.0.0, for example) this is only used for bug fixes, so don't expect every version to have a fourth number.

The example version said here is 1.2.3.4, not creative, I know.
